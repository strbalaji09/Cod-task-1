description:

The calculator program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and then asks for the desired operation. Based on the user's input, it performs the calculation and displays the result. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit. It includes error handling to deal with invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values or division by zero.
